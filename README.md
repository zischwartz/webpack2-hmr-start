A simple starting place using webpack 2, babel, react, jsx, css-loader, etc based on the [docs here](https://webpack.js.org/guides/hmr-react/).

To use, clone this repo, and then run `npm install` from this directory.

There are two `npm run` commands, `start` and `build:prod`. `start` runs the webpack dev server with hmr. `build:prod` builds the app for production into `dist/`.
